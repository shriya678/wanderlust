# 🏕️ Wanderlust

> A full-stack accommodation rental platform where users can list, browse, review, and book unique stays around the world — inspired by Airbnb.

Wanderlust is a server-rendered web application built with **Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. It supports secure user authentication, image uploads to the cloud, owner-based authorization, and a clean review system with star ratings.

## ✨ Features

- **Browse listings** — explore all available stays on a responsive home page.
- **Create, edit & delete listings** — authenticated users can manage their own properties.
- **Cloud image uploads** — listing photos are stored on Cloudinary via Multer.
- **Reviews & ratings** — leave comments and 1–5 star ratings on any listing.
- **User authentication** — sign up, log in, and log out powered by Passport.js.
- **Authorization** — only a listing's owner can edit/delete it; only a review's author can delete it.
- **Session & flash messages** — friendly success/error feedback, with sessions stored in MongoDB.
- **Server-side validation** — request data is validated with Joi before hitting the database.
- **Cascade cleanup** — deleting a listing automatically removes its associated reviews.

```

This follows the **MVC pattern** — models define the data, controllers hold the logic, routes wire up endpoints, and views render the UI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20.10.0
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database (local instance or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas))
- A free [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (for image hosting)

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MajorProject
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# MongoDB connection string (Atlas or local)
ATLASDB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string

# Secret used to sign sessions
SECRET=your_session_secret

# Cloudinary credentials
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
```

> ⚠️ The `.env` file is git-ignored — never commit your secrets.

### 3. (Optional) Seed the database with sample listings

The seed script connects to a **local** MongoDB at `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wanderlust`:

```bash
node init/index.js
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
node app.js
```

The server runs at **http://localhost:4000**.
